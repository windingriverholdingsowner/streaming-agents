That's an excellent question. Yes, including negative prompts is a great way to improve the quality and control of your AI-generated images.

### What are Negative Prompts?

Negative prompts are terms you add to your prompt to tell the AI image generator what you *don't* want to see in the image. They help you refine your output by excluding unwanted elements, styles, or qualities.

### Why are they useful?

*   **Remove unwanted elements:** You can get rid of common AI-generated artifacts like extra limbs, distorted text, or blurry backgrounds.
*   **Improve quality:** You can improve the overall quality of the image by excluding terms like "ugly," "blurry," "low quality," etc.
*   **Refine the style:** You can guide the AI towards a more specific aesthetic by excluding styles you don't want (e.g., "cartoonish," "3d render").

### Common Negative Prompts

Here are some common negative prompts that you can use:

*   **For quality:** `ugly, blurry, low quality, jpeg artifacts, compression, noise, watermark, signature, text, username`
*   **For human figures:** `extra limbs, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, disfigured, deformed, bad anatomy`
*   **For style:** `cartoon, 3d, cgi, render, illustration, painting, drawing`

### Shall I add negative prompts to the existing prompt files?

I can go through the prompt files in the `prompts` directory and add a "Negative Prompt" section to each one with some of the common negative prompts listed above. This will give you a good starting point for generating high-quality images.

Would you like me to do that?
