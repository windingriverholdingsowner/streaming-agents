# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance to Gemini when working in this repository.

## Directory Overview

This repository contains resources for setting up "stealth streaming" - passive ambient live streams designed to showcase products from an Etsy shop. The project is focused on content creation and streaming setup, not traditional software development.

## Key Files

*   `CLAUDE.md`: Provides guidance for the Claude AI, and a good overview of the project.
*   `cozy_room_prompts.txt`: Contains AI prompts for generating cozy room backgrounds.
*   `stealth_streaming_conversation_summary.txt`: Documentation of the streaming setup approach.
*   `AI Prompt-a-thon.docx`: Additional prompt resources.
*   `product-images/`: A directory containing images of products to be showcased in the streams.

## Usage

The contents of this directory are intended to be used for:

1.  Generating AI-generated cozy room backgrounds using the provided prompts.
2.  Compositing product images into the generated scenes.
3.  Creating slideshows or video loops of the compositions.
4.  Streaming the content to multiple platforms (e.g., YouTube, TikTok, Instagram) to passively showcase products.
