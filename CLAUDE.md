# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains resources for setting up "stealth streaming" - passive ambient live streams designed to showcase products from thePUNShopTeesNGifts (an Etsy shop featuring pun-themed apparel, gifts, and home decor) across multiple platforms.

## Project Structure

The repository contains:
- `cozy_room_prompts.txt` - AI prompts for generating cozy room backgrounds (20 detailed prompts)
- `stealth_streaming_conversation_summary.txt` - Documentation of the streaming setup approach
- `AI Prompt-a-thon.docx` - Additional prompt resources

## Project Purpose

This is a content generation and streaming setup project focused on:
1. Creating AI-generated cozy backgrounds
2. Compositing product images into scenes
3. Setting up multi-platform streaming for passive product showcase

## Key Workflow

1. Generate cozy room backgrounds using AI image generation tools
2. Composite product images into the generated scenes
3. Create slideshow or video loops of the compositions
4. Stream to multiple platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram) simultaneously

## Important Notes

- This is not a traditional software development project
- Focus is on content creation and streaming setup rather than code
- The prompts are designed for photorealistic, high-quality outputs suitable for streaming
- Product placement should look natural within the cozy scenes
