## AI Image Generator Recommendation

Based on the existing prompts in this project and the goal of creating photorealistic, high-quality images for live streaming, **Midjourney** is the recommended AI image generator.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Photorealism:** Midjourney is known for its ability to generate highly realistic and detailed images, which is a key requirement mentioned in the existing prompts ("photorealistic", "4k", "cinematic lighting").
*   **Artistic Control:** It offers a good balance of control and artistic interpretation, allowing for the creation of specific moods and aesthetics (e.g., "cozy hygge aesthetic", "whimsical and magical").
*   **Community and Resources:** Midjourney has a large and active community, which means there are many resources, tutorials, and community-generated prompts available for inspiration and learning.

**Alternative:**

*   **DALL-E 3:** If ease of use and accessibility are a higher priority, DALL-E 3 (available through ChatGPT Plus) is a good alternative. It is known for its ability to understand natural language prompts very well.
